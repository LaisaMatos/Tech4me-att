            Feeling my way through the darkness
            Guided by a beating heart
            I can't tell where the journey will end
            But I know where to start 
            <br></br>
            They tell me I'm too young to understand
            They say I'm caught up in a dream
            Well, life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
            Well, that's fine by me.
            <br></br>
            <em>So wake me up when it's all over
            When I'm wiser and I'm older
            All this time I was finding myself
            And I didn't know I was lost</em>

            I tried carrying the weight of the world
            But I only have two hands
            I hope I get the chance to travel the world
            But I don't have any plans
            <br></br>
            Wish that I could stay forever this young
            Not afraid to close my eyes
            Life's a game made for everyone
            And love is a prize
            <br></br>
            So wake me up when it's all over

            And I didn't know I was lost

            So wake me up when it's all over
            When I'm wiser and I'm older
            All this time I was finding myself
            And I, I didn't know I was lost
            <br></br>
